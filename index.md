Hi, I'm Raveesh.

I've been building products since 2010, first as the founder of a small mobile app development studio, then the first employee of [Haptik.ai](https://haptik.ai) and most recently as a product/design consultant. I focus heavily on design to help people accomplish their goals, and code as a means to bring the design to reality.

Over my career, I've had the privilege to learn from a diverse range of teams, users and problems. On this site, I'll elaborate on some of the projects I've been involved in. If you'd like to reach out, the simplest way is to follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/raveeshbhalla).
